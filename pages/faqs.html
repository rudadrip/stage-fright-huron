                        All purchased tickets, digital or physical, are accompanied by a confirmation message and ID sent via email or text message. These can be shown to the help desk or ticket counter to receive a replacement ticket. In the event that you do not have this confirmation message for any reason you may contact our online support or a help desk at a performance for assistance. To make the process easier please ensure you have the billing information used for your purchase ready.

                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        Generally we do not offer discounts for bulk purchases, however, very significant orders may receive a discount determined on a case-by-case basis.

                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        If you bought your ticket from this website or from a verified vendor there is no need to be worried since these tickets will always be legitimate. Tickets obtained from other sources can be inspected for an ID number, the correct date, time, and location, and a valid section and seat for the ticket type. If all of these are correct a ticket is more likely legitimate than false but this is not guaranteed and we cannot ensure you will be admitted.
                      </p>
                      <h5>
                        7. What happens to my ticket if a concert is cancelled or moved?
                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        If a concert gets cancelled or moved there are a few options available depending on what happened. If a concert was moved all tickets for the original date will still be valid, if you cannot make the new date you may contact customer service to either exchange it for an equivalent ticket for another performance, or exchange it for credit that can be used on other Stage Fright products. If a concert is cancelled all tickets will be immediately converted to credit but you may request it be replaced by a cash refund by contacting customer service.

If you're ever in doubt if an item is allowed or not, it's generally wise to not bring it.

                        7. Why is your website so simple?
                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        Because we're not done here! Our values for functionality over looks and a massively successful first song combined and forced us to release a very simple website for our fans. Now that the crunch is over, we're working hard to improve its visual appeal. Unfortunately, adding more visuals causes a website to become more distracting and harder to use so we have to tread lightly in order to keep the website up to our standards. We appreciate your understanding!<br>

                        8. Why is there a singular blue underline in the table of contents for the terms of service page?
                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        Despite the best efforts of our top programmers we were unable to figure out what was causing the problem. If you have a solution to this problem please contact us at bugs@stagefright.com for a bounty.
